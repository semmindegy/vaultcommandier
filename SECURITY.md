# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please do **not** create a public issue.
Instead, email the maintainer at the address in the repo or use a private communication channel.

We will respond as soon as we do and coordinate remediation and disclosure, unless we panic, in which 
case nobody can tell what'll happen.
